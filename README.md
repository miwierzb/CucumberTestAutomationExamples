## Usage

***1. PROJECT STRUCTURE***

- All core framework classes can be found under ./src/main/java/com/assignment/core
- All POM Pages classes can be found under ./src/main/java/com/assignment/selenium
- All API POJO classes can be found under ./src/main/java/com/assignment/api

*Test classes:*
- All API Test classes can be found under ./src/test/java/com/assignment/api
- All Selenium Test classes can be found under ./src/test/java/com/assignment/selenium

***2. TEST DATA***

All test data can be found in ./src/test/resources/test.data.properties file.

***3. CUSTOM LOGGER***

Custom logger is set to DEBUG mode as default, configuration can be found in ./src/main/resources/log4j.properties. 

DEBUG mode contains all INFO loggs (steps and step related informations) and DEBUG logs specified in 'WebEventListener' class (e.g. beforeNavigateTo, afterNavigateTo, beforeFindBy, afterFindBy etc.). To turn off DEBUG mode and see only INFO logs please change line in log4j.properties from:
```bash
log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG, file, stdout
```
to
```bash
log4j.rootLogger=INFO, file, stdout
```

If you don't want to get logs extracted to file, remove 'file' from line above.

More information about logger levels avaliable in log4j documentation.
